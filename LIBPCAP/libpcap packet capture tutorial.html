<b>Front matter:</b>  This is a slightly modified and extended version
of my older pcap tutorial.  Revisiting this work five years later, I am
necessarily dumber (age and beer) yet hopefully somewhat more
knowledgeable.  Contact information has changed, please send your

<b>Who this is for: </b>  This tutorial assumes a cursory
knowledge in networks; what a packet is, Ethernet vs. IP vs.
TCP vs. UDP etc. If these concepts are foreign I highly suggest
you invest in a <b>good</b> (e.g. probably can't find at Best Buy)
networking book.  My favorites are:<br>

<li>
Computer Networking : A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet
(3rd Edition) by James F. Kurose, Keith W. Ross<br>
</li><li> 
UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard Stevens
</li><li>

</li></ul>

This tutorial does not assume any previous knowledge in network
programming, just a basic familiarity with c.  If you already are a
c/c++ master, then you might as well just <b>man 3 pcap</b>.  You should
have a working c compiler on your system and libpcap installed.  All
source in this section was written and tested on linux, kernel 2.2.14,
while it should be mostly portable (hehe) I can't guarantee that it will
compile or run on other operating systems.  You are going to want to run
as root so be careful and be sure not to break your box in the meantime.
Oh, and though I have tested and run all the code presented in this
tutorial with no problems, I am NOT responsible if your shit breaks and
has to be quarantined by the health department...  aka play at your own
risk....

<b>Intro:</b>
Finally, you've made it (either by reading, skimming or skipping) to the
start of the tutorial.  We'll start at the verryyy begining and define a few
thing before getting into the nity-grity -- howver if you are eager to
get moving, scroll to the bottom of this page, cut, paste, compile and
enjoy. For the rest of you, the following two definition may give you a
clue about what we are doing, what the tools we will be using.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  <b>Packet Capture</b> Roughly means, <i>to grab a copy of packets
off of the wire before they are processed by the operating system</i>. Why
would one want to do this?  Well, its cool.  More practically, packet
capture is widely used in network security tools to analyze raw traffic
for detecting malicious behaviour (scans and attacks), sniffing,
fingerprinting and many other (often devious) uses. 

</li><li> <b>libpcap</b> "provides implementation-independent access to the
underlying packet capture facility provided by the operating system"
(Stevens, UNP page. 707).  So pretty much, libpcap is the library we are
going to use to grab packets right as they come off of the network card.
</li></ul>

<b>Getting Started</b>
Well there is an awful lot to cover.. so lets just get familiar with
<b>libpcap</b>.  All the examples in this tutorial assume that you are
sitting on an Ethernet.  If this is not the case, then the basics are
still relevant, but the code presented later on involving decoding the
Ethernet header obviously isn't :-( *sorry*.  Allright... crack your
knuckles *crunch* and lets get ready to code our <b>FIRST LIBPCAP
PROGRAM :)</b>.  Go ahead and copy the following program into your
favorite editor (which should be <b>vim</b> if you have any sense :-)
save, and compile with... <br><br> <b>%&gt;gcc ldev.c -lpcap</b>
</p>
<hr noshade="noshade">
<pre>/* ldev.c
   Martin Casado
   
   To compile:
   &gt;gcc ldev.c -lpcap

   Looks for an interface, and lists the network ip
   and mask associated with that interface.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;pcap.h&gt;  /* GIMME a libpcap plz! */
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
#include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
#include &lt;arpa/inet.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  char *dev; /* name of the device to use */ 
  char *net; /* dot notation of the network address */
  char *mask;/* dot notation of the network mask    */
  int ret;   /* return code */
  char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE];
  bpf_u_int32 netp; /* ip          */
  bpf_u_int32 maskp;/* subnet mask */
  struct in_addr addr;

  /* ask pcap to find a valid device for use to sniff on */
  dev = pcap_lookupdev(errbuf);

  /* error checking */
  if(dev == NULL)
  {
   printf("%s\n",errbuf);
   exit(1);
  }

  /* print out device name */
  printf("DEV: %s\n",dev);

  /* ask pcap for the network address and mask of the device */
  ret = pcap_lookupnet(dev,&amp;netp,&amp;maskp,errbuf);

  if(ret == -1)
  {
   printf("%s\n",errbuf);
   exit(1);
  }

  /* get the network address in a human readable form */
  addr.s_addr = netp;
  net = inet_ntoa(addr);

  if(net == NULL)/* thanks Scott :-P */
  {
    perror("inet_ntoa");
    exit(1);
  }

  printf("NET: %s\n",net);

  /* do the same as above for the device's mask */
  addr.s_addr = maskp;
  mask = inet_ntoa(addr);
  
  if(mask == NULL)
  {
    perror("inet_ntoa");
    exit(1);
  }
  
  printf("MASK: %s\n",mask);

  return 0;
}

<p>
Did you run the program?  If not, run it :-) Assuming it compiled,
and ran correctly your output should be something like...<br>
<br>
DEV: eth0<br>
NET: 192.168.12.0<br>
MASK: 255.255.255.0<br>
<br>
The value for DEV is your default interface name (likely eth0 on linux,
could be eri0 on solaris). The NET and MASK values are your primary interface's
subnet and subnet mask.  Don't know what those are? Might want to read 
<a href="http://www.linux-tutorial.info/modules.php?name=Tutorial&amp;pageid=145">this
</a>.
</p>
<p>
"So what did we just do?", you ask.  Well, we just asked libpcap
to give us some specs on an interface to listen on.<br>
"Whats an interface?"<br>
Just think of an interface as your computers hardware connection to
whatever network your computer is connected to.  On Linux, eth0 denotes
the first Ethernet card in your computer.  (btw you can list all of your
interfaces using the <b>ifconfig</b> command).
</p>
<p>
OK at this point we can compile a pcap program that essentially does
nothing.  On to grabbing our first packet ... </p>
